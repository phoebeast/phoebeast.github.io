prep-time: 10 mins
cooking-time: 5 mins
servings: 1

ingredients:
- 1/4 can of corned beef
- 1 egg
- 2 slices of bread, crust removed
- white pepper
- Olive oil

instructions:
- Open up a can of corned beef and use a quarter of the amount
- Heat up olive oil in a saucepan on medium heat until hot, then add the corned beef
- When the corned beef is separated and slightly sizzling, crack an egg into the pan and break it up
- Mix it around until the beef is coated evenly with the egg. Add a few dashes of white pepper to taste
- Assemble this into a sandwich, enjoy!

notes:
- 1 can of corned beef can be portioned into 4 sandwiches. I normally separate the portions into sandwich bags and freeze them. When I want to make this sandwich, I will take it straight out of the freezer and into the saucepan

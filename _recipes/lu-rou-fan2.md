ingredients-subheaders:
- subheader: Beef
  ingredients: 
  - 225g flank steak, sliced thinly against the grain
- subheader: Marinade
  ingredients: 
  - 3 tsp dark soy sauce
  - 4 tsp peanut oil
  - 2 tsp cornstarch
- subheader: Bittermelon
  ingredients: 
  - 2 medium-sized bitter melon, seeded and cut into 1cm slices
  - 2 tsp salt
- subheader: Sauce
  ingredients: 
  - 4 tsp oyster sauce
  - 3 tsp light soy sauce
  - 2 tsp dark soy sauce
  - 2 tsp sugar
  - 1 tsp black pepper
- subheader: Stir Fry (mix in a small bowl)
  ingredients: 
  - 2 tbsp peanut oil - separated
  - 2 large garlic cloves - chopped
  - 3 slices of garlic - chopped
  - 2 Tb black bean sauce or fermented black beans - soaked in hot water for 1 minute, drained and mashed
  - 1 tsp sugar
  - 4 tsp Shaoxing wine

instructions:
- Combine the beef and marinade ingredients in a bowl. Mix until the beef is fully coated. Set aside for it to marinade for 15 minutes
- Cut the bitter melon length-wise and scoop out the seeds with the "white sponge" attached to it. Slice the bitter melon into half-moon shape so it will cook evenly and won't fall apart. Sprinkle salt over it and toss with your hand until it is coated well. Let it sit for 10 minutes. Rinse off the salt. Blanch the bitter melon in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain out the hot water and rinse it under cold tap water to stop the cooking. Drain and place the bitter melon into a bowl
- Pour peanut oil in a saucepan and heat over medium heat until hot. Add the garlic and black bean sauce, then stir for 30 seconds to release the fragrance. Lower the heat if the black bean sauce starts to burn
- Add the bitter melon and sugar. Stir and cook for another minute. Transfer everything to a big bowl and set side
- Add more oil into the saucepan along with the ginger. Cook and stir for 30 seconds
- Turn to medium-high heat and add the marinated steak. Let it cook undisturbed for 1 minute or until the bottom is browned. Flip the meat and cook until the other side is browned. It is okay if the inside of the beef is still slightly pink
- Pour in the wine, add the sauce and stir, until it slightly thickens
- Add back the cooked bitter melon. Stir fry until the sauce reaches the desired consistency and everything is evenly coated
- Transfer everything to a big bowl and serve over steamed rice

notes:
- Adding salt to the bitter melon will extract some of the bitter juice from the bitter melon. Blanching it in boiling water is also done to further reduce the bitterness

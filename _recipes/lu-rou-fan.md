- subheader: Preparation
  instructions:
  - Add the dried shiitake mushrooms into a bowl and pour 1 cup of boiling water. Rehydrate for at least 20 minutes or until the mushrooms turn tender throughout. Once rehydrated, remove the shiitakes from their soaking liquid and squeeze out extra water. Slice them into 1cm strips and reserve the soaking liquid
  - Cut the pork belly into thin slices about 1/2cm thick. Transfer the pork belly into a medium-sized bowl. Add the Shaoxing wine and dark soy sauce. Mix well. Let marinate for 20-30 minutes
  - Hard boil 4 eggs and run the cooked eggs under cold water to stop the cooking. Peel the eggs
- subheader: Braise the pork
  - In an oiled pan on medium heat, add the marinated pork belly. Stir fry until the meat is lightly browned
  - Pour in the Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, star anise, cinnamon, crispy shallots and shiitake mushrooms. Stir fry for 30 seconds, until everything is mixed together and well coated
  - Add the cup of mushroom soaking liquid (do not add the sediments) and 1 cup of water
  - Bring the pan to a boil then reduce to low heat. Simmer until the meat is tender and the liquid is reduced to a thin sauce, for about an hour. In the last half-hour, add in the boiled eggs and intermittently turn them over
  - Once the pork turns tender and the sauce has thickened, remove the pot from the heat. Serve over steamed rice with blanched buk choy

notes:
- Make sure to check throughout the braising process, as it can burn if you leave it for too long!

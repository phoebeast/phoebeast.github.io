servings: 4

ingredients-nosubheader:
- 8 dried shiitake mushrooms
ingredients-subheaders:
- subheader: Meat Marinade
  ingredients: 
  - 450g pork belly, cut into thin strips
  - 2 tsp Shaoxing wine
  - 1 tsp dark soy sauce
- subheader: Braising
  ingredients: 
  - 8 dried shiitake mushrooms
  - 1 Tb crispy shallots
  - 2 Tb Shaoxing wine
  - 2 Tb soy sauce
  - 2 garlic cloves, chopped
  - 1 Tb dark soy sauce
  - 1 Tb white sugar (or rock sugar)
  - 2 star anise pods
  - 1 tsp ground cinnamon (or 1 cinnamon stick)
  - 4 hard boiled eggs

instructions:
- Combine the beef and marinade ingredients in a bowl. Mix until the beef is fully coated. Set aside for it to marinade for 15 minutes
- Cut the bitter melon length-wise and scoop out the seeds with the "white sponge" attached to it. Slice the bitter melon into half-moon shape so it will cook evenly and won't fall apart. Sprinkle salt over it and toss with your hand until it is coated well. Let it sit for 10 minutes. Rinse off the salt. Blanch the bitter melon in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain out the hot water and rinse it under cold tap water to stop the cooking. Drain and place the bitter melon into a bowl
- Pour peanut oil in a saucepan and heat over medium heat until hot. Add the garlic and black bean sauce, then stir for 30 seconds to release the fragrance. Lower the heat if the black bean sauce starts to burn
- Add the bitter melon and sugar. Stir and cook for another minute. Transfer everything to a big bowl and set side
- Add more oil into the saucepan along with the ginger. Cook and stir for 30 seconds
- Turn to medium-high heat and add the marinated steak. Let it cook undisturbed for 1 minute or until the bottom is browned. Flip the meat and cook until the other side is browned. It is okay if the inside of the beef is still slightly pink
- Pour in the wine, add the sauce and stir, until it slightly thickens
- Add back the cooked bitter melon. Stir fry until the sauce reaches the desired consistency and everything is evenly coated
- Transfer everything to a big bowl and serve over steamed rice

notes:
- Adding salt to the bitter melon will extract some of the bitter juice from the bitter melon. Blanching it in boiling water is also done to further reduce the bitterness

tags: dinner, chestnut, chicken

cooking time: 1 hour
servings: 4

Ingredients:
- 8 dried shiitake mushrooms (sliced in half)
- 680g of chicken drumsticks, cut into 3 bite-sized pieces
- 3 Tb light soy sauce
- 12 chestnuts (fresh or frozen)
- Peanut oil
- 3 spring onions: 2 chopped into 5cm pieces and 2 finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, smashed
- 2 ginger slices
- 3 Tb Shaoxing wine
- 1 Tb dark soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 Tb rock sugar (or 1 Tb regular sugar)
- 1 star anise pod
- 1 piece cinnamon stick (or 1 tsp ground cinnamon)
- Optional: 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns
- Optional: 1 tsp sesame oil

Instructions:
- Add 1/2 cup of hot water to the shiitake mushrooms. Soak until it is soft throughout. Gently rub the mushrooms to remove any debris and squeeze out excess water. Cut them in halves. Reserve the soaking liquid
- Add the cut chicken pieces and light soy sauce into a bowl. Toss to mix well and set aside
- Boil a pot of water over high heat. For fresh chestnuts, slice the bases and boil. When cooked, peel the chestnuts and let it air dry. If using peeled frozen chestnuts, boil according to package instructions
- In a saucepan, add oil and heat over medium heat. Add the chestnuts. Cook, until lightly browned. Transfer to a bowl
- Add the spring onion, garlic, ginger and soaked mushrooms. Cook until lightly browned and transfer them into the bowl with the chestnuts
- Add the chicken pieces without overlapping. Cook until the bottom side is lightly browned, then flip to brown the other side
- Pour 1 1/2 cups of water into the saucepan. Add the 1/2 cup of mushroom soaking liquid but be careful not to add the residual bits
- Add the Shaoxing wine, dark soy sauce, kosher salt, sugar, star anise pod, cinnamon and Sichuan peppercorns. Add the cooked chestnuts with the aromatics. The liquid should cover most of the chicken but if not, add more water
- Cook over medium-high heat until the broth comes to a low boil. Maintain cooking this uncovered for 25 minutes or until the chicken turns very tender
- Once the cooking is done, the broth should be reduced to coat the chicken with a thin layer
- Sprinkle chopped spring onions for garnish (optional: drizzle sesame oil)
- Serve hot over steamed rice

Recipe notes:
- If there is too much broth left but the chicken is tender, transfer the chicken to a serving bowl and keep reducing the broth over high heat until it thickens
- Keeping the broth at a low boil instead of a simmer will help some of the oil/fat to emulsify with the broth, which yields a thick flavourful glaze at the end. If you prefer a thin broth, you will need to simmer the chicken instead
